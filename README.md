## Why Another Minimal Starter...?

Gatsby plays well with new wave static site hosts such as <a href='https://www.netlify.com/'>netlify.com</a>

A fat, fully featured site means a slower cycle waiting for content to be updated. Use this **Coming Soon** sign to quickly get a site up and running so that DNS and SSL can be sorted out whilst you work on your content.
